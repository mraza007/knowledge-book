- `M` for `markdown` mode and `Y` for command mode.
- `%env` This is going to print environment variables.
- `%pdb` activates `pdb` debugger.
- `%pylab` allows to work interactively with `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
- `%%debug` activate debbugging mode in cell.
- `%%html` renders cell as html.
- `%%latex` renders cell as latex.
- `%%sh` shell script.
- `%%time` time command to see how long it took to run the command.


These are my personal favorites for jupyter-notebook.
