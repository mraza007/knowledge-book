So I  found a useful command that allows you to view entire git log of the repo. 

```console
git log --decorate --graph --oneline --all
```

This command generates the entire log of the git repo in one line

and if you like to view entire log with commit messages in detail you can run this command

```console
git log --decorate --graph --all
```

I hope you found this useful and if you have further tips related to command line feel free to follow me and DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/muhammad_o7)
