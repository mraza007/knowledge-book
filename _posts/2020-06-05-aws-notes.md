### What is Cloud Computing.

Its the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,manage and process data rather using a local server or personal computer.

### Benefits of the cloud computing.

- No upfront costs such as paying for server. You can Pay On Demand.
- Economies of sale you can simply save alot of money since there are so many people using the cloud.
* You can scale up or scale down based on your need.
- With few clicks of a button your service is deployed.
- No more maintenance costs.
- Go global in few minutes since there are global regions where cloud servers are hosted.

### Types of Cloud Computing.
- `SaaS` --> Software as a Service. Basically a complete product that is ran and managed by the service provider.(Examples: Salesforce,Gmail,GoogleDocs)
- `PaaS` --> Platform as a Service. Focusing on deploying applications without worrying about managing the infrastructure.
(Examples: Heroku,Netlify and etc)
- `IaaS` --> Infrastructure as a Service. The building blocks of the IT. Providing computers access and storage needs and etc.
(Examples: AWS,GCP and Azure).

### Cloud Computing Models
- Cloud (Fully hosted on Cloud such as startups)
- Hybrid (On-Premise and Public Cloud such as Banks)
- On-Premise (On Private Cloud where sensitive data is being stored).

### `AWS` Global Infrastructure.
- There over a million active customers using `aws`.
- there are total `69` Availability Zones `22` Geographic Regions around the world.
- `Regions` --> physical location with multiple availabilty zones.
- `Availability Zones(AZ)` --> one or more discrete data locations.(owned by aws)
- `Edge Locations` --> data center owned by trusted partner of `aws`

### Regions `AWS`.
- A geographically distinct location with multiple data centers.
- Each region has two `AZs`.
- `US-EAST(North Virginia)` is the largest `AWS` region and services almost always become available first in this region.
- Not all services are available in the all regions.
- `US-EAST-1` is where you see your billing information.


### AZs(Availability Zones)
- Each Region has two AZs.
- An AZ is a data center ran and owned by AWS.
- less than 10ms latency between `AZs`

### Edge Locations (Get Data Fast or Upload Data Fast).
- A data center owned by trusted partner of `AWS` and has direct connection to the `aws` network.
- These location serve requests for `CloudFront` and `Route53`. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically.
- `S3 Transfer accelaration`  and `API Gateway ` endpoint also use the `AWS Edge Network`.
- This allows for low latency no matter where ever you are located.

### GovCloud
An `AWS` service that allows customers to host sensitive Controlled 
`Unclassified Information` or other types of workloads

- Only operated by `US Citizens` or on the `US Soil`.
- Should follow several compliance guidelines.
- [GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/?whats-new-ess.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-ess.sort-order=desc)


### EC2 Instances
- In order to create a `EC2` instance head over to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
- Choose `EC2` and follow along. Make sure you select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI` and select the type as `t2.micro` since that is offered with free tier.
- Now follow along and make sure to set IAM role.
- lastly make sure you have billing alerts turned on.
- You can either use `ssh` or `sessions manager` to get into `ec2` instance.
- You can also get to `sessions-manager` by going to `systems manager`.
- `sessions-manager` opens a simple `bash` shell that can help you access your `ec2` instance.

### AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- You can create an image by going into `ec2` management console and clicking on actions and selecting `image`.
- Basically this creates a copy that allows you launch multiple servers.

### AutoScaling 
- This allows you ensure that multiple instances and multiple servers are running.
- This also allows you meet the demand of web traffic.
- In order to configure this its located in `ec2` management console.

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELBs)
- This allows reroute the traffic. especially when doing updates to the application.

### S3 Buckets
- Its usually global and the buckets are usually region specific.
- its a block storage used to store the files.

### CloudFront (CDN).
- CloudFront is basically Cotent Delivery Network. 
- It makes easier for companies to distribute there content.
- Hook it up to S3 Bucket and deliver your content around the world.

### RDS (Relational Database Service)
- It's used to setup a relational database (Examples: SQL,PSQL).
- Amazon aurora would be default when setting up this service
- It has auto scaling.

### AWS Lambda
- Serverless framework.
- Allows you to run simple functions you can think of it as cronjobs.

# EC2 Pricing Models.
E2 has four different pricing models

### On Demand
- Low Cost and Flexible.
- only charges per hr
- short term 
- good for first time apps or prototypes.
- No upfront payment.

### Reserved Instances.
- Good for committed applications.
- Standard savings 75% (Cannot change the RI attributes.)
- Best for long term
- You can schedule to reserve the instances.
- there's a commitment like 1 to 3 year with AWS.
- RI's can be shared between multiple accounts.
- You can even sell your unused instances.

### Spot instances.
- You can think of it has a hotel who offers discounts to fill there spots.
- Just like hotel `aws` uses similar approach to maximize the usage of there idle servers.
- There are conditions such as, 
    + Instances can be terminated anytime.
    + If you instance gets terminated you dont get charged for partial hour of usuage.
    + If you terminate an instance you will be charged for any hour that it ran.
- Good for applications feasible for very low usage.
- It provides you 90% savings.

### Dedicated
- Its the most expensive `EC2` instance.
- Its built for tenant customers. Its more useful for large enterprises.
- Its offered both in demand and reserved.
