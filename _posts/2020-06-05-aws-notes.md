## AWS Cloud Practioner
This certification is mostly used by people to get the understanding of the `AWS` services. 

## Where you can take this exam ?
You can take this exam on Pearson VUE online.

- This cost $100
- 90 mins
- 65 Questions
- 70% passing score
- Valid for 3 years.

## Exam Guide 
This is what exam mostly comprises of 
- Cloud Concepts `28%`.
- Security `24%`
- Technology `36%`
- Billing & Pricing `12%`

We have total of `65` questions and most of them are `mutiple choice` or `multiple response` questions.


## What is Cloud Computing

Its the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,manage and process data rather using a local server or personal computer.

## Benefits of the cloud computing

- No upfront costs such as paying for server. You can Pay On Demand.
- Economies of sale you can simply save alot of money since there are so many people using the cloud.
* You can scale up or scale down based on your need.
- With few clicks of a button your service is deployed.
- No more maintenance costs.
- Go global in few minutes since there are global regions where cloud servers are hosted.

## Types of Cloud Computing
- `SaaS` --> Software as a Service. Basically a complete product that is ran and managed by the service provider.(Examples: Salesforce,Gmail,GoogleDocs)
- `PaaS` --> Platform as a Service. Focusing on deploying applications without worrying about managing the infrastructure.
(Examples: Heroku,Netlify and etc)
- `IaaS` --> Infrastructure as a Service. The building blocks of the IT. Providing computers access and storage needs and etc.
(Examples: AWS,GCP and Azure).

## Cloud Computing Models
- Cloud (Fully hosted on Cloud such as startups)
- Hybrid (On-Premise and Public Cloud such as Banks)
- On-Premise (On Private Cloud where sensitive data is being stored).

## `AWS` Global Infrastructure
- There over a million active customers using `aws`.
- there are total `69` Availability Zones `22` Geographic Regions around the world.
- `Regions` --> physical location with multiple availabilty zones.
- `Availability Zones(AZ)` --> one or more discrete data locations.(owned by aws)
- `Edge Locations` --> data center owned by trusted partner of `aws`

## Regions `AWS`
- A geographically distinct location with multiple data centers.
- Each region has two `AZs`.
- `US-EAST(North Virginia)` is the largest `AWS` region and services almost always become available first in this region.
- Not all services are available in the all regions.
- `US-EAST-1` is where you see your billing information.


## AZs(Availability Zones)
- Each Region has two AZs.
- An AZ is a data center ran and owned by AWS.
- less than 10ms latency between `AZs`

## Edge Locations (Get Data Fast or Upload Data Fast)
- A data center owned by trusted partner of `AWS` and has direct connection to the `aws` network.
- These location serve requests for `CloudFront` and `Route53`. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically.
- `S3 Transfer accelaration`  and `API Gateway ` endpoint also use the `AWS Edge Network`.
- This allows for low latency no matter where ever you are located.

## Gov Cloud
An `AWS` service that allows customers to host sensitive Controlled 
`Unclassified Information` or other types of workloads

- Only operated by `US Citizens` or on the `US Soil`.
- Should follow several compliance guidelines.
- [GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/?whats-new-ess.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-ess.sort-order=desc)


## EC2 Instances
- In order to create a `EC2` instance head over to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
- Choose `EC2` and follow along. Make sure you select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI` and select the type as `t2.micro` since that is offered with free tier.
- Now follow along and make sure to set IAM role.
- lastly make sure you have billing alerts turned on.
- You can either use `ssh` or `sessions manager` to get into `ec2` instance.
- You can also get to `sessions-manager` by going to `systems manager`.
- `sessions-manager` opens a simple `bash` shell that can help you access your `ec2` instance.

## AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- You can create an image by going into `ec2` management console and clicking on actions and selecting `image`.
- Basically this creates a copy that allows you launch multiple servers.

## AutoScaling
- This allows you ensure that multiple instances and multiple servers are running.
- This also allows you meet the demand of web traffic.
- In order to configure this its located in `ec2` management console.

## Elastic Load Balancer `(ELBs)` 
- This allows reroute the traffic. especially when doing updates to the application.

## S3 Buckets
- Its usually global and the buckets are usually region specific.
- its a block storage used to store the files.

## CloudFront `(CDN)` 
- CloudFront is basically Cotent Delivery Network. 
- It makes easier for companies to distribute there content.
- Hook it up to S3 Bucket and deliver your content around the world.

## RDS `(Relational Database Service)`
- It's used to setup a relational database (Examples: SQL,PSQL).
- Amazon aurora would be default when setting up this service
- It has auto scaling.

## AWS Lambda
- Serverless framework.
- Allows you to run simple functions you can think of it as cronjobs.

## EC2 Pricing Models
E2 has four different pricing models

### On Demand
- Low Cost and Flexible.
- only charges per hr
- short term 
- good for first time apps or prototypes.
- No upfront payment.

### Reserved Instances
- Good for committed applications.
- Standard savings 75% (Cannot change the RI attributes.)
- Best for long term
- You can schedule to reserve the instances.
- there's a commitment like 1 to 3 year with AWS.
- RI's can be shared between multiple accounts.
- You can even sell your unused instances.

### Spot instances
- You can think of it has a hotel who offers discounts to fill there spots.
- Just like hotel `aws` uses similar approach to maximize the usage of there idle servers.
- There are conditions such as, 
    + Instances can be terminated anytime.
    + If you instance gets terminated you dont get charged for partial hour of usuage.
    + If you terminate an instance you will be charged for any hour that it ran.
- Good for applications feasible for very low usage.
- It provides you 90% savings.

### Dedicated
- Its the most expensive `EC2` instance.
- Its built for tenant customers. Its more useful for large enterprises.
- Its offered both in demand and reserved.

It will alert you of the findings which you can automate an incident response via `CloudWatch` Events or 3rd Party Software.

## KMS (Key Management System)

A managed service that makes it easy for you to create or control the encryption keys used to encrypt that data.
- `KMS` is a multi-tenant HSM (Hardware Security Model).
- Many AWS services are intergrated to use `KMS` to encrypt your data with simple checkbox.
- `KMS` uses Envelope Encryption.

### Envelope Encryption
When you encrypt your data, your data is protect but you have to protect your encryption key. When you encrypt your data key with master key as an additional layer of security. [READMORE](https://lobster1234.github.io/2017/09/29/aws-kms-envelope-encryption/)

            <th>Security Groups</th>
            <th> Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Acts as a firewall at the instance level. </td>
            <td>Acts as a firewall at the subnet level</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Implicitly denies all traffic. You create Allow rules (For Example allow an `EC2` Instance to access `port 22`)</td>
            <td>You create `allow` and `deny` rules </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>



## AWS VPN(Virtual Private Network)

It allows you create a secure and private tunnel from your network or device to the aws global network.

**AWS Site-to-Site VPN** : Securely connect to on premises network or branch office site to VPC.
**AWS Client VPN:** Securely connect users to AWS or on premises networks.

## Same Name But Different Services (Don't Get Confused)
- `CloudFormation`: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) used to setup template scripting (`YAML`,`JSON`).
- `CloudTrail`: logs all the `api` calls between `aws-services` (who to blame).
- `CloudFront`:  CDN(Content Delivery Network),It is used to distribute the content (Such as videos,static assets and etc).
- `CloudWatch`: a collection of multiple services
- `CloudSearch`: search engine for your site (Ecommerce).

## AWS Connect Services
- `Direct Connect`: A dedicated fiber optics connections from data center to AWS.
Lets say an enterprise want a direct connection from there on premise datacenter to aws they might use this service to connect to AWS. 
If you want to add extra layer of security you might need a `vpn` connection.

- `Amazon Connect`: Call Center Service.

- `Media Connect`: A new version of Elastic Transcoder, Converts videos to different formats.

Lets say you have 1000 videos and you need to transcode them into different formats then this might be a useful service. You can even add watermarks and insert intro infront of every video.

## `SNS` vs `SQS`

They Both Connect Apps via Messages.

### SNS
- It uses `PubSub` model which is also known as publisher subscriber model.
- It sends notifications to subscribers via protocols such as `HTTP`,`Email` `SQS` and `SMS`.
- It is generally used for sending `plaintext` emails which is triggered via other `aws` services. The best example can be billing alerts.
- Can retry sending in case of failure for `HTTPS`.
- Its good for `webhooks`,internal emails and triggering lambda functions.

### SQS (Examples `RabbitMQ`) - (think of it as message broker service)
