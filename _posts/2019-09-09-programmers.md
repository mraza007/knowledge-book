- [x] I learned about deploying django webapps using gunicorn and nginx. I was able to deploy full fledge application on raspberry pi.
- [x] I was able to configure NGINX and serve static files on the client side.
- [x] Learned about public and private IP addresses. most of the private IP addresses start with `192.XXX.XXX.XXX` or `172.XXX.XXX.XXX`
- [x] `:%s/$/HelloWorld/` This command allows to add something end of the line(Note:This command saved me so much time when formating data.)
- [x] `:%s!^!//!` This vim command will add something in the beginning of the line.
